R-1.12 Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a
random element from a non-empty sequence. The random module includes a more 
basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to
the built-in range function, that return a random choice from the given
range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version
of the choice function.
